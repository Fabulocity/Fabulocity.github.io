<h2><b>NOT FOR MOBILE</b></h2>
<h1> Approach</h1>
<p>
There are two paradigms to approach for the end-user platform. 
<ul>
  <li>A runtime web engine with open-source file types</li>
  <li>A game engine compiler delivering a stand-alone exeuctable, such as <i>Unity</i>.</li>
 </ul>

<p>
A runtime web experience has the benefit of quick deployments, low to zero license fees. There are many open-source projects that can be forked to get a prototype up and running quickly, but the general lack of end-to-end standards makes for a more confusing development pipeline. 

<p>
Unity offers a game building environment with many easy to use tools, especially valuable for WYSIWYG UI. Unity can be used without cost during academic/development phases, but requires a license for any commercial deployment.

<p>
The runtime engine route will cost more in time to get an equivalent outcome, but a more flexible development pipeline. A Unity route requires multiple platform-dependent builds, and more time for updates. 

<H1>Runtime Web</H1>
<p>

The runtime engine will utilize Three.js standards. Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

<p>
3d file assets will use the glTF/gltb file formats. glTF is a standard file format for three-dimensional scenes and models. A glTF file uses one of two possible file extensions, .gltf or .glb. A .gltf file may be self-contained or may reference external binary and texture resources, while a .glb file is entirely self-contained.
